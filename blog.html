                <p>On the first leg, there were no options for the airplane food, but they served everyone the same thing. They called it a light breakfast, and on the tray was a croissant, a muffin, fruit, some cheeses, and a selection of different cold cut meats. The meats and cheese were pretty good.</p>

              <h3> Kewa datshi is potatoes and Bhutanese cheese.</h3>
                <p>
                  Kewa is potato, so kewa datshi is potatoes and Bhutanese cheese. It surprised me by how similar kewa datshi is to a dish similar to scalloped potatoes.The potatoes are typically sliced into thin pieces, then sautéed down with cheese and lots of butter. Sometimes cooks will toss in a few chilies or tomatoes, but usually, this is a Bhutanese dish that’s pretty mild, but just focuses on potatoes and cheese.</p>

                <h3>Wonderful Bhutanese food of dried beef cooked with dried chilies</h3>
                <p>During my month staying in Bhutan, shakam paa quickly became one of our favorite protein dishes of choice. Again, the beef is slightly chewy from being dried and preserved, and it’s combined with lots of dry chilies.One thing we loved about Bhutanese cooking is how the chilies are just tossed in whole — don’t worry about slicing things up and making them look pretty — you get the whole chilies in Bhutan, amazing.</p>

                <h3>Ema Datshi, which is chilies and cheese.</h3>
                <p>You’ll eat ema datshi not only everyday when you’re in Bhutan, but likely for just about every meal when you’re in Bhutan. The chilies, which can be either fresh green chilies or dry red chilies, are sliced lengthwise, and cooked with datshi, which is local Bhutanese cheese, and plenty of butter for good measure.</p>

                <p>If you love spicy, there are a lot of incredibly spicy foods to eat when you’re in Indonesia. But there was one dish that topped them all in the spicy department for me.When We were in Jakarta, many people recommended We try a type of Indonesian grilled chicken dish, called Ayam Bakar Taliwang, mentioning “since you love spicy food, you’re going to love it.”</p>

                <p>One of the reasons We love to travel so much is to taste local foods, and I also love nothing more than trying something We’ve never tried before.When We noticed the reindeer steak on the menu at Restaurant Pelikan, just like the råbiff, we absolutely had to go for it.</p>
