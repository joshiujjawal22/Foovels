						<p>I have to acknowledge that it may have been a better idea to get a vegan to taste test this, as my tastebuds are coming from a world of seared steak and piquant gooey cheese.If my diet had consisted largely of legumes and vegetables for the past little while, this might have been a fairer test.But nobody else was available and that's showbiz, baby.There are a few things to note on initial encounter with this "cheeseburger".The first is I have never seen "cheese" behave like that. This vegan cheese has the same consistency as a bus ticket, and arguably less flavour.</p>

								<h3>Pani-Puri</h3>
								<p>It takes some serious street food genius to come up with something like pani puri; Who would think to add flavored water to a circular chip that gets soggy?We'r here to tell you, it works extremely well, and it’s an absolute stunner of an Indian street food.The little puris are poked with a hole, half stuffed with potatoes and chickpeas, seasoned with spices, and filled with chutney and flavored water. As soon as the vendor hands you one, you’ve got to eat it on spot immediately so the puri remains crunchy, and the spice filled water will collapse in your mouth with the potatoes and chickpeas.Pani puri is a just a wonderful thing to eat. However, since it does contain water, do be cautious where you eat it.</p>

								<h3 class="text-center">Dosa</h3>
								<p>Although dosas are originally from South India, since Mumbai is such a melting pot of India, the dosa is also a very common street food in Mumbai.A dosa is made from a batter of rice and urad bean flour which is lightly fermented, and then fried on a hot circular plate in a thin crepe like shape. Once it’s golden and crispy on the bottom, any number of fillings can be added to the center. The traditional version is the masala dosa, where masala potatoes are added to the dosa, and it’s served with sambar and coconut chutney on the side.But in Mumbai you’ll find some fusion and very creative types of dosas as well, where both Indian and Chinese dishes are served with the dosa, and they work so well.</p>

								<h3>Kebabs and Rolls</h3>
								<p>On this list of top Mumbai street food you’ll find a lot of vegetarian food (and I happen to think some of the world’s best vegetarian food is in India), but kebabs and rolls are undoubtedly non-veg.Mumbai has a number of legendary restaurants that serve delicious kebabs and rolls, and one of my personal favorites are the Mumbai bhuna rolls. Bhuna rolls are made with boneless chicken which is cooked in a spice filled gravy, and wrapped within a freshly cooked rumali roti, which is a thin roti that’s very similar to a tortilla.A bhuna roll is the perfect late night snack that you want to be eating at about 3 am in the morning, and feeling really good about it.</p>

								<h3>Duck-Fry</h3>
								<p>Although Bombay duck is also served at indoor restaurants and local spots in Mumbai, we had to include it on this food list because it’s a favorite food in Mumbai. Although it’s called Bombay duck (or bombil), it’s not really duck at all, but it’s a type of lizardfish.The lizardfish is coated in a layer of semolina, then deep fried to a crisp. The result is a crispy outer edge and the fish remains creamy and oily on the inside. Bombay duck is a fantastic dish to eat in Mumbai, and it goes particularly good with a full thali meal that includes rice, chapati, and a variety of side curries to enhance everything.When I visited Mumbai, Bombay duck was one of the foods we were most looking forward to eating, and it was wholly satisfying with every bite.</p>

								<h3>Palak Chaat</h3>
								<p>Before we had to surrender of richness overdose (We can’t eat too many snacks without eating some rice and carbs to break the richness), he handed us one more concoction: Palak (spinach) Chaat.Ok, there wasn’t much spinach in this chaat despite its name, but there were a few leaves embedded into a deep freed crispy fritter that was then smothered in thick curd and the same host of spices and garnishes on top. It was a crunchy, yoghurty, spicy, sour mishmash, that was delicious too.</p>

								<h3>Bot-Chein</h3>
								<p>One of the best places to eat delicious food in Vietnam is down alleys or deep into markets.While exploring all sorts of tasty foods in Saigon, one day We were walking down a side street, when we saw a sign for “Bot Chein,” along with a makeshift permanent food cart, and We knew We needed to sit down for a bite to eat.</p>
